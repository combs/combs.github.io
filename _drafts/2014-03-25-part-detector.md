## What is it? 

## What problem does it solve? 

## What was my role in it? 

## How does it work? 

A circuit board I designed and assembled with carefully selected resistors and transistors provides the reference voltages needed for it to work reliably.

It accepts common probes through its banana jack ports, and has an internal battery that occasionally needs to be recharged.

For software, it uses a version of the "ArduTester" firmware that I modified to better support the type of screen I use here. ArduTester was itself based on "Transistor Tester" code.
