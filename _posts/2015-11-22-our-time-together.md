## What is it?

This device remembers the time that humans have spent in its company. It has a sequel, [Our Time Together II](/2018/04/20/our-time-together-ii/).

## Where has it been shown?

It was on display at [1460 Wallmountables 2017](http://www.dcartscenter.org/events2.htm) at the DC Arts Center until September 10, 2017.

## What was my role in it?

I created *Our Time Together*.

## How does it work?

It sends a ping, much like a bat, once every few seconds. Once it notices a human nearby, it perks up and begins counting the seconds spent together.
