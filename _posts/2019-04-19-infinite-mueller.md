## What is it? 

This Twitter bot used to share fragments of an infinite Mueller Report, generated by a neural network. 

It was terminated by Twitter Developers for having "an overlapping use case." I don't know what this means. I was told that there was no appeal and that further communications from me would be deleted.

Here is the full list of possible reasons (they didn't bother to specify which one) for the account's termination:

- "Creating serial and/or multiple accounts with overlapping use cases
- "Evading a permanent suspension through the creation or use of a different account
- "Cross-posting Tweets or links across accounts
- "Aggressive following, particularly through automated means"

This was the only account, it didn't cross-post anything, and it didn't follow anyone. 

Perhaps it scared them.
