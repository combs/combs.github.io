## What is it? 

This essay of multiple-exposure photographs and text aims to convey the strange, impressionistic qualities of dreams.

## What problem does it solve? 

How can I show dreamlike imagery in a photographic print?

## What was my role in it? 

I photographed each of the original pictures, and edited them down to a selection of images that worked well as triple or double darkroom exposures.

## How does it work? 

These pictures are each three negatives sandwiched together into a single negative carrier, and printed in a color darkroom. 

## Backstory 

I made the images some time ago, and recently assembled them into this essay.
