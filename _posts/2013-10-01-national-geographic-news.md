## What is it? 

National Geographic's daily news site has photo essays and articles about the latest in science, animals, and photography.
 
## What problem does it solve? 

As a reader of news, I want to learn about surprising new developments without being depressed. 

## What was my role in it? 

I was the photo editor of National Geographic News from January 2009 to October 2013. 

My main responsibility was to choose photographs for articles and to make photo galleries. I had to find photographs or illustrations that conveyed ideas, even the very complex or abstract. 

Much of our visual coverage was edited from the archives of agencies and photographers. I assigned photographers to make bespoke images for significant story packages. 

I also worked with several photo editors who contributed to Nat Geo News, including [Adrian Coakley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-coakley-4b83972b), [Sherry Brukbacher](http://www.brukbacher.com/), and [Caroline Couig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolineecouig). I was responsible for setting the editorial and visual tone of the site, as well as maintaining a budget and negotiating relationships with image vendors.
 
## How did it work? 

I researched new gallery and story ideas through networking, photo databases, scientific publications, social networks, and current events. 

## Backstory 

Galleries were a major driver of traffic to Nat Geo News during my tenure.
