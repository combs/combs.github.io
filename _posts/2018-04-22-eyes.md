## What is it?

This small device watches for nearby faces. When someone is detected, their eyes are plotted using bright red LEDs that shine through the wooden front panel.

## What was my role in it?

I fabricated "Eyes" with custom-designed circuit boards and a hand-assembled and designed LED matrix. The matrix uses a new and powerful LED matrix controller that does not yet have commercially available or open source software, so I designed a display driver for it too. The case is made of wood PLA, which I designed and 3D printed; a dark veneer completes the appearance.

## How does it work?

A Raspberry Pi Zero watches for eyes using OpenCV and a Haar cascade recognition model.
