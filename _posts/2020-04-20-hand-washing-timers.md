## What is it?

These hand-washing timers count down the 20 seconds required to zap COVID-19 when washing your hands with soapy water. 

<a href='https://combs.bigcartel.com'><b>Want one? Order here!</b></a>

You turn it on by waving your hands in front (no touch); it counts down seconds after a short delay to let you get your hands in the soap + water. It has a red LED screen (shows yellow-orange in the photo because it's super bright!). A clear cover lets you wipe the front surface clean if you should happen to touch it.

Some fine print: <b>THIS IS NOT A HEALTH OR MEDICAL DEVICE.</b> It's just a timer!

The picture shows a real prototype. I am still finalizing the clear cover, paint, and other small details; there may be other small changes, but this shows about what you'll receive. BTW, these timers are not my invention--I've designed these particular versions but can't take credit for the idea!

These timers come in three sizes:

<a href="https://combs.bigcartel.com/product/no-touch-hand-washing-countdown-timer-large"><b>BIGGIE.</b></a> Box is 7" wide, with 5” wide numbers. (Least bright)

<a href="https://combs.bigcartel.com/product/no-touch-hand-washing-countdown-timer-medium"><b>NORMY.</b></a> Box is 5" wide, with 2” wide numbers. 

<a href="https://combs.bigcartel.com/product/no-touch-hand-washing-countdown-timer-small"><b>KAWAII.</b></a> Box is 4" tall, with 1.25" wide chunky pixel screen. (Most bright)

Note that the BIGGIE-sized screen is dimmer, and is hard to read in direct sunlight.
