## What is it? 

[Nat Geo View](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nat-geo-view/id958610015?mt=8) is a daily content app for iPhone.

## What problem does it solve? 

How can I start my busy day with a quick, inspiring look at Nat Geo's visual stories?

## What is my role in it? 

I produce Nat Geo View's daily content, along with two other producers. I helped create its content plan. I have also been working with its product managers on changes and improvements.

## How does it work? 

We adapt existing Nat Geo content to this app's format, picking and choosing the best available content each day. Its designers imagined it as a daily content experience, rather than an hourly or as-it-happens stream, so we consider each day as a mix of content and strive to keep each varied.

## Backstory 

Nat Geo View was launched in February 2015 for iPhone.
