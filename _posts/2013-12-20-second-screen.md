## What is it? 

This small screen lets you keep important information always visible. It attaches to a computer and can be configured to display any short text.

## What problem does it solve? 

It's easy for important updates or statistics to be overlooked while using a modern computer, with many windows and tabs. This simple screen lets you concentrate on what's important, such as commute alerts or upcoming calendar events. 

Or you can use it as a source of delight and whimsy in your day, by showing short quotes, facts, or unusual words.

## What was my role in it? 

I made this device, using standard hardware components with a modified version of a SparkFun firmware.

The enclosure is diecast aluminum that I drilled and cut to accommodate its screen, USB port, and brightness dial.

## How does it work? 

It connects via USB to a computer, and presents itself as a standard serial port. You can use most programming languages (even a shell script) to place text on the second screen.

## Backstory 

I love the idea of deciding what's most important in your life, and keeping it in your line of sight.
