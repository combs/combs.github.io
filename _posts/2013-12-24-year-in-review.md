## What is it? 

This multimedia web experience includes more than a hundred of National Geographic's most surprising stories from 2013.

## What problem does it solve? 

As a user, I don't know how to find the best content from National Geographic's many brands. 

Year in Review 2013 combined all of Nat Geo's identities into one.

## What was my role in it? 

I worked with [Dana Fraser](http://danavfraser.com) to produce this feature. We solicited, organized, and edited submissions from many different groups at Nat Geo to make a holistic view of our large organization. 

[Jody Sugrue](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=12115280&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile) and [Kate LaRue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katelarue) designed the feature and crafted a lot of its multimedia sensibility, working with [Pam Chen](http://pamelachen.com) and [Mike Schmidt](http://www.mohawkstreet.com). Many of us dove into the scripts and stylesheets to get this live in time, but [Chris Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-moore-13651040) did a lot of the heavy lifting, as did [Joel Fiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelfiser). [Amy Bucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-bucci-012a1a4) helped with many launch issues over the holidays. 

## How does it work? 

The site is static HTML and JavaScript, built using much of the existing ["Serengeti Lion"](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/serengeti-lion/index.html) codebase. It uses HTML5 video.

## Backstory 

We were constrained by the need to use an existing design and codebase without making major changes. This was a serious tradeoff: the site doesn't work on mobile, and it is difficult to navigate back to each source story as a user of the site. But we were able to spend more time focusing on the content and less on the technology as a result of this decision. 

It drew many visitors, and they spent a lot of time engaging with the site. We considered it a successful brand play.
