Think of a typical computer screenâ€¦ an orderly grid of rows and columns of pixels. What if you messed up the grid? How garbled could it get, and still be able to show a recognizable image?

This steel industrial enclosure has 500 holes drilled in it, using an algorithm that dictated the placement of each hole. It's designed to mimic the human eye, with centralized focus towards the center. Each hole reveals a tiny portion of a screen inside the device, which is displaying a video of footage captured and edited by the artist. 

The video shows scenes of environmental change: glacial meltwaters, geothermal venting, eroding human structures.
