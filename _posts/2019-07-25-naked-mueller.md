## What is it?

Most of the text in this 448-page printed report was generated by a neural network (a human was used to write the title page and format/lay out the text; no other editing was performed).

The neural network was trained from two source materials:

- OCRed text from the publicly released, redacted Mueller Report
- Text of "Naked Lunch," by William S. Burroughs

When training a character generating neural network, one of the levers you can pull is "dropout"--how many neurons are removed each training cycle. Brain damage, if you will. I chose a moderate amount of brain damage for this network.
