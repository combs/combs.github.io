## What is it?

Using facial recognition hardware and a model provided by Google for schoolchildren in its "AIY Vision Kit," sold at Target, this artwork scans for nearby faces. If each face is deemed sufficiently cheerful, they count towards a meter of "smiling faces." 

If illumination levels get low, when it notices a face, it uses a built-in warm white light to get a better view of it. (but it does turn off completely after no faces have been observed for a few seconds--so as not to annoy at night.)
