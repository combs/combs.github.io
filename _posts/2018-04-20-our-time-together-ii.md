## What is it?

Get close to this machine, and it remembers: a small display counts up the number of seconds spent in its company.

## What was my role in it?

I designed and fabricated *Our Time Together II*. Its case is 3D-printed wood PLA that I painted and finished; its display is a custom designed circuit board that I created to use a vintage "bubble" display first employed in 1970s wristwatches and calculators.

## How does it work?

It has two range sensors, but the laser rangefinder "nose" does most of the work. Once this sensor notices a human nearby, it perks up and begins counting the seconds spent together.

## Backstory

This device is a sequel to [Our Time Together]({% post_url 2015-11-22-our-time-together %}), which did not have a nose.
