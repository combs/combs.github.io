## What is it?

Hold the button and speak your civic request into this easy-to-use home Bureautron; a short time later, after dialing its modem into the central government, you will be notified whether your request was approved or denied. If you don't like this outcome, just try again!

## What was my role in it?

I designed and fabricated *Bureautron*. Its case is a commercially available blank aluminum enclosure that I milled openings into and coated with dry molybdenum lubricant spray to give it a dark sheen; a laser cutter removed the spray to form labels.

## How does it work?

An Arduino provides the audio logic and decides whether to deny each request.
