## What is it? 

A National Geographic grantee discovered a possible new human ancestor. We wanted to debut this exciting research across our platforms, including a flagship show with NOVA and a cover story on our magazine. 

The story debuted online with a feature that Amy Bucci and I produced.

## What problem does it solve? 

How can we integrate all of Nat Geo's fractured brands in a cohesive online story? 

## What was my role in it? 

Amy and I worked with magazine and television colleagues to adapt and rethink this as an online-first series of stories. 

Our content plan included more than a dozen companion pieces and followups, continuing the conversation across our sites and blogs.

## How does it work? 

The [main story](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150910-human-evolution-change/) was published in our Nat Geo News site, with embedded responsive interactives crafted by the Nat Geo magazine's graphics staff and bespoke videos from the field. 

## Backstory 

As of 12/1/2015, our *Homo naledi* feature has drawn the second-largest number of unique visitors to our News site of any stories this year&mdash;bested only by [cats and cucumbers](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151117-cats-cucumbers-videos-behavior/).
