## What is it?

Think of a typical computer screenâ€¦ an orderly grid of rows and columns of pixels. What if you messed up the grid? How garbled could it get, and still be able to show a recognizable image?

This piece's screen is arranged with this method: 192 LED pixels, arranged at random, focused a little towards the center.

It uses this screen to show you a sparkling interpretation of any movement observed in front of the device. Can you see yourself?
