## What is it? 

I had the incredible privilege of editing one of [Your Shot](http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/)'s first [photo assignments](http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/assignments/night/). I asked for submissions from anyone, and guided the group through update messages and comments. 

When we hit deadline, I looked at all 8,039 submissions and chose 35 photos to include in [our story](http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/stories/night/). I explained why we chose some images and what made them work&mdash;and how other community members could learn from them. 

## What problem does it solve? 

An aspiring photographer might not always feel inspired by their environment.

My goal as an editor was to help everyone see their lives in a new light&mdash;and  capture what makes them special.

## What was my role in it? 

I edited the story and guided the community during its three-week submission period.

## How does it work? 

The Your Shot community is open to anyone. Its photo assignments are creative prompts for members, inviting anyone to share their creativity for possible inclusion in a final, published story.

## Backstory 

This was one of Your Shot's first assignments as it prepared to relaunch the community with many new features. The response from our members was almost overwhelming. I had a blast and I hope they did too.
