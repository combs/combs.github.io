## What is it?

This modified See 'n' Say has had its animal sounds replaced with feelings, like "Nostalgia," "Heartbreak," and "Did Stuff."

## What was my role in it?

This is a collaboration between [A.C. Valdez](https://acvaldez.com/), Chris Combs, and [Rachel Kaufman](http://readwriterachel.com). My role was to design the hardware and software. A.C. Valdez composed the sounds and Rachel Kaufman provided creative direction and helped fabricate its enclosure.

## How does it work?

The original (electronic) See 'n' Say was modified to isolate its original sound-generation circuitry. Two microcontrollers were installed, one to handle input (arrow and crank) and the other to generate sound. A rechargeable battery and charging jack have been installed and the original battery bay has been repurposed to hold one of its microcontrollers.
