## What is it?

The ZIP/ZCTA Deaccessioning Console lets you browse the database of all ZIP codes in the United States, view their population and vital statistics, and then delete them.

Once a ZIP code (technically, ZCTA) is removed from the Console, it is permanently deleted from its storage. After all of them are removed, the machine will crash forever.

## What problem does it solve?

Wouldn't we all act a little differently if we were in charge? This machine lets you imagine that you draw the lines. Who can say if it has any effect?

## What was my role in it?

The ZIP/ZCTA Deaccessioning Console is designed and created by Chris Combs.

## How does it work?

It was initially programmed with a database of all ZCTAs. Two microcontrollers, an ESP8266 and an ATMega328 (Arduino Pro Mini), share the work. It is set in the 1990s.

## Backstory

This is one of a series of Machines of Conspiracy, fictional devices that appear to let you be in charge.
