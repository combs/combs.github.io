## What is it? 

A recent trip to Glacier National Park in Montana resulted in many pictures. I couldn't share them at the time because of poor cellular service, so I laterstreamed it chronologically on Instagram.

## What problem does it solve? 

How can I share many images of an interesting place on Instagram without overwhelming everyone's feed?

(Update: Instagram has since added a Stories feature that solves the same problem.)

## What was my role in it? 

I took far too many photographs--11,000--and selected a number of them to post to Instagram.

## How does it work? 

Max of one photo an hour.

## Backstory 

It was really fun to revisit these images, and I gained 24% followers!
