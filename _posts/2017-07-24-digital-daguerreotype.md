## What is it?

This artwork displays alternate-reality daguerreotypes on an unusual mirrored screen.

## Where has it been shown?

It was on display at [1460 Wallmountables](http://www.dcartscenter.org/events2.htm) at the DC Arts Center until September 10, 2017.

## What was my role in it?

I created the Digital Daguerreotype's artwork and device.

## How does it work?

It changes images every 30 minutes.

## Backstory

I found the remarkable reflectiveness of the LCD very much like a daguerreotype; its image is hard to see unless the lighting is just right. You have to hunt around a bit to find it.
