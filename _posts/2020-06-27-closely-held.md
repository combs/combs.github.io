## What is it?

"Closely Held" is net art, best on phones, that lets you smoosh through short sounds with a "fun-house mirror" effect. It gently deals with themes of anxiety. 

"Sound Scene" is an audio art festival that celebrates the sonic magnetism of Washington DC and has featured artists from Michigan, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Spain, Italy, India, Armenia, South Korea, Germany, and elsewhere. For 2020 it was all online and free, June 27-28, 2020, at [soundscenefest.org](https://soundscenefest.org).
