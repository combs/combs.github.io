## What is it?

This device from a future dystopia allows you to assess the chemical value of an idle human by analyzing the gases in their breath.

## What was my role in it?

I designed and created this device. It was fabricated with custom-designed circuit boards, CNC-milled aluminum, and laser toner transfer.

## How does it work?

"Extraction Potential" uses gas sensors from the "MQ" series to assess the relative increase or decrease of gases, such as alcohol and carbon dioxide, when someone breathes into the device. Its analysis cycle is triggered when it detects a statistically significant increase in humidity. After a dollar amount is determined and displayed on its vintage 1970s Monsanto LED displays, the air in the device is purged with an internal blower fan.
