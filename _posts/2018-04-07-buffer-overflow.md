## About the Exhibition

The art machines in this pop-up show at the Fab Lab DC show you a future that has gone a little strange. Using handmade, custom-fabricated, and hacked hardware and software, works such as "Bureautron" and "ZIP/ZCTA Deaccessioning Console" purport to let you shape reality, while "Feeling Lucky" seems to reflect the viewer—until you get a little closer.

*Was on display from April 7–25 by appointment.*
