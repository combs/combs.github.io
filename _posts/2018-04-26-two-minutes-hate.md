## What is it?

This screen, for use in the home, monitors for "enemies of the state" and includes their faces in the Two Minutes Hate, a special program shown every half hour alongside scraping and other harsh noises.

## What was my role in it?

I designed and fabricated this machine. It is assembled from many smaller sub-components that connect with tabs and slots.

## How does it work?

A Raspberry Pi is continually monitoring a camera; multiple Python processes harvest faces, display them, play sound, and handle other software tasks.
