## What is it?

This artwork is powered solely by the heat of a tea candle. This heat is consumed by a thermoelectric generation element (a "Peltier" element, used in the opposite configuration from its typical cooling application). The small voltage generated by this is fed to a boost converter to power a candle LED. 

It is made of soft aluminum, finished in several different ways. Evidence of hand-working can be found on close inspection. It is a fingerprint magnet and should be handled carefully, as it can scratch.
